                <h2>What is Outer Space</h2>
                <p>Space is the area beyond the upper limits of Earth’s atmosphere. It is where all of the asteroids, comets, planets, stars, solar systems and galaxies
                  in our universe are found. Space is a vacuum, meaning it contains almost nothing, but it is not completely empty.</p>
                <p>Outer space, or simply space, is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard
                  vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields,
                  neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins
                  (−270.45 °C; −454.81 °F). The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a
                  number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins. Local concentrations of matter have
                  condensed into stars and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts
                  with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the
                  observable universe is dark energy, a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume
                  of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.</p>

                          <p class="text-content" id="sun"><b>The Sun</b> is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal
                          convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter
                          is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about
                          99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with
                          much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>
                          <p class="text-content" id="mercury"><b>Mercury</b> is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest
                          of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within
                          Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the
                          planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a
                          bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar
                          to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.</p>
                          <p class="text-content" id="venus"><b>Venus</b> is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
                          second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad
                          daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the
                          east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis
                          than any other planet in the Solar System and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east).
                          Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among planets in the Solar System.</p>
                          <p class="text-content" id="earth"><b>Earth</b> is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to
                          radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially
                          the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 solar days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year.
                          During this time, Earth rotates about its axis 366.256 times, that is, a sidereal year has 366.256 sidereal days.</p>
                          <p class="text-content" id="mars"><b>Mars</b> is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being only larger
                          than Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of
                          the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is
                          a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps
                          of Earth.</p>
